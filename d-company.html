            D-Company is a name coined by the Indian media for one of Mumbai underworld's organized crime syndicate founded and controlled by Dawood Ibrahim, an Indian crime boss, drug dealer and wanted terrorist. In 2011, Ibrahim, along with his D-Company, was number three on FBI's "The World's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives" list.<br/><br/>It has been designated as a Global Terrorist Organization under the SDN by the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, with addresses in India, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Overview ==<br/><br/>Shabir Ibrahim Kaskar and Dawood Ibrahim established a criminal syndicate in 1970s India.<br/><br/>Other prominent members of the gang include Chhota Shakeel, Tiger Memon Yakub Memon (linked), Abu Salem and Fazlur Rahman (Fazal Sheikh). The organization has a history of rivalry with the Mumbai police and other underworld dons such as Chhota Rajan, Ejaz Lakdawala, who was arrested in Canada in 2004, and Arun Gawli.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In the 1970s, Dawood Ibrahim worked for a local smuggler named Bashu Dada. Bashu Dada was close friends with Dawood's father, who was a policeman. His father wielded immense clout among the gangsters and common people due to his sense of morality and justice, while also being a part of the Crime Branch. However, Bashu Dada and Dawood had a falling-out after Bashu Dada insulted the latter's father.
