            The Saxon Motor Car Company was located in Detroit, Michigan, from 1914 to 1922. In 1917, 28,000 cars were made, making it the seventh largest car maker in the United States.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Hugh Chalmers of Chalmers Motor Car Company  began the company to market a low priced volume car.  The first Saxon was a 2-seat runabout with 2-speed transmission and a four-cylinder engine made by Ferro and built in the old Demotcar factory. 7,000 were made in the first year of production. The cost of a Saxon in 1913 was $395, equivalent to $12,567 in 2024. <br/><br/>From 1913 to 1914, electric lighting was an extra option, which became a standard fitting to the car in 1915.  Also available in 1915 was the Saxon Six, a five-passenger tourer, with a 30–35 hp (22–26 kW) Continental six-cylinder, electric starter and headlights, on a 112 in (2845 mm) wheelbase and 32×3½-inch (81×8.9 cm) wheels, all for $785, equivalent to $24,400 in 2024. <br/><br/>In 1914 a Saxon roadster was driven 135 miles a day for 30 days, for a total of 4,050 miles with an average of 30 mpg. It was among the first cars to christen the new Lincoln Highway.
