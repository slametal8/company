            The American Locomotive Company (often shortened to ALCO, ALCo or Alco) was an American manufacturer that operated from 1901 to 1969, initially specializing in the production of locomotives but later diversifying and fabricating at various times diesel generators, automobiles, steel, tanks, munitions, oil-production equipment, as well as heat exchangers for nuclear power plants.<br/><br/>The company was formed by the merger of seven locomotive manufacturers and Schenectady Locomotive Engine Manufactory of Schenectady, New York. A subsidiary, American Locomotive Automobile Company, designed and manufactured automobiles under the Alco brand from 1905 to 1913. ALCO also produced nuclear reactors from 1954 to 1962. After World War II, Alco closed all of its manufacturing plants except those in Schenectady and Montreal.<br/><br/>In 1955, the company changed its name to Alco Products, Incorporated. In 1964, the Worthington Corporation acquired the company. The company went out of business in 1969, although Montreal Locomotive Works continued to manufacture locomotives based on Alco designs.<br/><br/>The ALCO name is currently being used by Fairbanks Morse Engine for their FM|ALCO line.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Foundation ===<br/><br/>The company was created in 1901 from the merger of seven smaller locomotive manufacturers with the Schenectady Locomotive Engine Manufactory of Schenectady, New York:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Brooks Locomotive Works in Dunkirk, New York<br/><br/>Cooke Locomotive &amp; Machine Works in Paterson, New Jersey<br/><br/>Dickson Manufacturing Company in Scranton, Pennsylvania<br/><br/>Manchester Locomotive Works in Manchester, New Hampshire<br/><br/>Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania<br/><br/>Rhode Island Locomotive Works in Providence, Rhode Island<br/><br/>Richmond Locomotive Works in Richmond, Virginia<br/><br/>The consolidation of the seven manufacturers was the brainchild of financier Pliny Fisk Sr.
