            Equitable Holdings, Inc. (formerly The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States and AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company, and also known as The Equitable) is an American financial services and insurance company that was founded in 1859 by Henry Baldwin Hyde.<br/><br/>In 1991, French insurance firm AXA acquired majority control of Equitable. In 2004, the company officially changed its name to AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company.: 26  In January 2020, it changed its name to Equitable Holdings, Inc. following its spinoff from AXA and the related public offerings beginning in May 2018.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States opened its headquarters at the Equitable Life Building in 1870 in the Financial District of Manhattan, with entrances facing Broadway, Pine Street, and Cedar Street. Aside from Henry Baldwin Hyde, who was president of Equitable, the firm's officers included James Waddell Alexander (vice president); George W. Phillips (actuary), who was Vice President of the Actuarial Society of America; and Samuel Borrowe (secretary), a member of a prominent New York family connected to the Hallett and Alsop families.<br/><br/>Between 1889 and 1891, Equitable built the Palais Equitable at Stock-im-Eisen-Platz, today part of the Stephansplatz, in the Innere Stadt of Vienna, Austria.<br/><br/>James Waddell Alexander was the company president at the time of the Hyde costume ball scandal in 1905. James Hazen Hyde, the son of the founder and a vice president of the company, was falsely accused through a media smear campaign initiated by Alexander and board directors E. H. Harriman, Henry Clay Frick and J.P. Morgan of charging a fabulous $200,000  Versailles-themed affair to the company.
