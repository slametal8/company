            The British American Land Company (BALC) was a company formed in 1832 for the purpose of purchasing land and encouraging British immigration to Lower Canada. It was founded and promoted by John Galt, Edward Ellice <br/><br/>and others to acquire and manage the development of almost 1,100,000 acres (1,719 sq mi; 4,452 km2) of Crown land and other lands in the Eastern Townships of Lower Canada, in order to encourage the immigration of British subjects to the region. <br/><br/>In comparison to the Canada Company, a similar enterprise in Upper Canada that thrived through collaboration with the local government, the BALC indulged in land speculation, made immigration a secondary priority, and struggled throughout its existence.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Origin and formation ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Following the success of the Canada Company in spurring settlement efforts in Upper Canada, similar efforts were initiated to establish a similar company to promote settlement in the Eastern Townships of Lower Canada. <br/><br/>A group of investors in Montreal, headed by Francis Nathaniel Burton, proposed organizing a Lower Canada Land Company, and sent William Bowman Felton to London to promote their venture. While there, he encountered a group with similar objectives. The groups decided to combine together, and, at a meeting in February 1832, decided to proceed with creating the British American Land Company.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was incorporated by royal charter in March 1834, and secured a local act from the Parliament of the United Kingdom, enabling it to:<br/><br/><br/><br/>operate directly in any of the provinces and colonies in British North America by virtue of the royal charter, and appoint commissioners and agents for the purpose of purchasing and disposing of land therein;<br/><br/>where any seigniorial lands are acquired by the company (whether held à titre de fief et seigneurie, à titre de fief en arrière-fief, or à titre de cens), commute all feudal and seigniorial rights, so that such lands will be held in free and common socage (and any Crown lands acquired by the company would have the same status); and<br/><br/>hire indentured servants, for periods of time not to exceed seven years, for service in British North America.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Commissioners ==<br/><br/>The following Commissioners were appointed during the existence of BALC:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Peter McGill and George Moffatt (acting jointly) (1834-1835)<br/><br/>Arthur C. Webster (1835-1837)<br/><br/>John Fraser (1837-1844)<br/><br/>Alexander Tilloch Galt (1844-1855)<br/><br/>Richard William Heneker (1856-1902)<br/><br/>James Davidson (1903-)<br/><br/>George Cate<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Land holdings and later interests ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Initial activities ===<br/><br/>In December 1833, it was announced that an agreement had been reached with Edward Smith-Stanley, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, to acquire a total of 847,661 acres (1,324 sq mi; 3,430 km2) for a purchase price of £120,000. This consisted of 596,325 acres (932 sq mi; 2,413 km2) of unsurveyed lands in the County of Sherbrooke; together with 251,336 acres (393 sq mi; 1,017 km2) in Crown reserves and surveyed Crown lands in the Counties of Sherbrooke, Shefford and Stanstead.
