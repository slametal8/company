            The American Steamship Company (ASC) is an American transportation company that operates a fleet of self-unloading vessels in the Great Lakes. The company is currently owned by Rand Logistics Inc. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The American Steamship Company was founded in 1907 in Buffalo, New York by partners John J. Boland and Adam E. Cornelius.  Their first ship, the SS Yale was the first steel vessel owned by a Buffalo firm and earned large profits for the partners.  Over the next five years, the company added six new vessels to their fleet.<br/><br/>At the end of World War I, the American Steamship Company became the first Great Lakes steamship company to outfit all of its vessels with radio telegraph equipment.<br/><br/>ASC acquired the Mitchell Steamship Company in 1922, thus adding another four vessels to its growing fleet.<br/><br/>ASC was hard hit by the Great Depression, but took advantage of the downturn to convert three of its bulk freighters to self-unloading vessels, which would prove to be the way of the future in Great Lakes shipping.  In the 1940s, self-unloaders would bring new business to ASC, and the focus of the company would shift from transporting iron ore and grain to shipping coal and limestone.  During World War II, ASC was active in the war effort, at one point having twenty ships engaged in war trades around the world.
