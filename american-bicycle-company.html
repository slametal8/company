The company was formed to consolidate the manufacturers of bicycles and bicycle parts. In the 1890s the advancements in bicycle design led to unprecedented demand for the new Safety bicycles. The "American Bicycle Company" trust only lasted for three years.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early Bicycles ===<br/><br/>Early bicycles received the name Boneshakers because they were made of wood with hard wheels. Next was the "High Wheeler" also known as the Penny-farthing which was difficult and dangerous to ride.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Safety Bicycles ===<br/><br/>The Overman Wheel Company, founded 1882, was the first manufacturer of a safer bicycle in the United States: the design came to be known as a safety bicycle in the United States, in their factory complex in Chicopee, Massachusetts. During the 1880s there was great demand for bicycles because of the advancements in safety and design. One of the major advances which helped bicycles become popular were chain driven cycles with gears which allowed the bicycle to use smaller wheels. Inflatable rubber tires were also a great advancement which helped to make bicycles practical and possible.
