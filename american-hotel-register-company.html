            American Hotel Register Company is a manufacturer and supplier of hospitality products and services and is headquartered in Vernon Hills, Illinois.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History and background ==<br/><br/>American Hotel was founded in 1865 as a publisher of hotel travel directories and railroad maps. It was incorporated in 1896 with its current name as a manufacturer of its patented hotel registers. Around the turn of the century it was acquired by Thomas F. Leahy. His son, James F. Leahy Sr. took over after his death in 1932. James expanded the company from a printing company to a direct marketing, catalog company selling hotel specific products like luggage carts &amp; racks as well as maids carts. By the time of James Sr.'s death in 1986, his three sons, James Jr., Thomas, and Patrick had started growing the business from a direct marketing company to a full distribution, service based organization. By the end of the century they had 10 different distribution centers around the country and in Hawaii. American Hotel Register is now a full service distribution company that services all aspects of the hospitality industry.
