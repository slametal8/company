General American acquired the life reinsurance business of National Reinsurance of Canada, later renamed General American Life Reinsurance Company of Canada, thereby establishing its first international office; the Canadian business became RGA Life Reinsurance Company of Canada after RGA's initial public offering (IPO).<br/><br/>Incorporated in 1992 in the state of Missouri, Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (RGA) was formed as a holding company for GA's U.S. and Canadian reinsurance businesses. RGA was taken public by IPO in 1993 on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: RGA), with General American retaining a 65% share.<br/><br/>MetLife acquired General American in 2000, including its interest in RGA, and after 8 years of ownership, MetLife spun RGA off to become a fully independent company.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Awards ==<br/><br/>Ranked 223 on the 2023 Fortune 500 list, and named to the 2023 Fortune's list of the "World’s Most Admired Companies".
