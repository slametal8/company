<h3>NEC America Inc.</h3>
<p>Originally incorporated as Nippon Electric New York in 1963, NEC America served as NEC's initial foothold in the U.S. market. The company initially focused on importing and distributing NEC's telecommunications equipment to American businesses and government agencies. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, NEC America expanded its operations significantly, establishing regional offices across the country and developing localized support capabilities.</p>

<h3>NEC Home Electronics (USA)</h3>
<p>Established in October 1981, NEC Home Electronics (USA) focused on bringing NEC's consumer electronics products to the American market. The division was particularly successful with computer monitors and professional displays, establishing NEC as a leader in high-end display technology. During the 1990s, NEC Home Electronics introduced several groundbreaking products including some of the first large-screen plasma displays and high-resolution CRT monitors for professional applications.</p>

<h2>Key Business Areas and Technologies</h2>
<h3>Supercomputing and High-Performance Computing</h3>
<p>NEC's involvement in the U.S. supercomputing market through HNSX Supercomputers represents a significant chapter in the company's history. The joint venture with Honeywell, formed in October 1986, aimed to compete against established players like Cray Research and IBM in the high-performance computing market.</p>

<p>The 1997 dumping case, where HNSX and Fujitsu were found guilty of selling supercomputers below cost to win a contract with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, highlighted the intense competition in this sector. The International Trade Commission's ruling in favor of Cray Research demonstrated the challenges Japanese technology firms faced in penetrating the U.S. supercomputing market during this period.</p>

<h3>Biometric Identification and Public Safety</h3>
<p>In recent years, NEC Corporation of America has emerged as a leader in biometric identification technologies, particularly facial recognition systems. The company's NeoFace technology is used by law enforcement agencies across the United States for criminal identification and public safety applications. NEC's biometric solutions also include fingerprint, iris, and voice recognition systems that are deployed in various security and identification applications.</p>
