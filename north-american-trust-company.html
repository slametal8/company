            The North American Trust Company was a trust company based in New York City. It was organized in early 1896. At the start of 1898, the company was located in the American Surety Building at 100 Broadway. On April 3, 1900, the directors of the International Banking and Trust Company and the North American Trust Company  unanimously voted to merge the two organizations under the new name the North American Trust Company. Other organizations were acquired in 1901, and in 1905 the City Trust, the North American Trust, and the Trust Company of America merged in what the Times called "the most important trust company consolidation of recent years." The new company was named the Trust Company of America.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 1886–1899: Founding and branches ===<br/><br/>There was a North American Trust Company involved in litigation as of 1852 in Albany, New York.<br/><br/>The North American Trust Company was organized in early 1886, with a capital of $1 million.
