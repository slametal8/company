            The American Opera Company was the name of six different opera companies active in the United States. The first company was founded in New York City in February 1886, but lasted only one season. The second company grew out of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, and was active from 1924 up until 1930, when it went bankrupt following the Wall Street crash of 1929. The third company, located in Trenton, New Jersey, was active in 1937 only. The fourth company was actively performing in Philadelphia from 1946 through 1950.<br/><br/>The National Opera Company and New American Opera Company were consecutive successors of the 1886 company.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Jeannette Thurber's American Opera Company ==<br/><br/>The first American Opera Company was founded by patron of the arts Jeannette Meyers Thurber, who also established the National Conservatory of Music of America. It was incorporated in 1878 with an ambitious prospectus, which anticipated productions featuring "the largest regularly trained chorus ever employed in grand opera in America", "the largest ballet corps ever presented in grand opera in America", "four thousand new and correct costumes for which no expense has been spared in fabric or manufacture", and scenery "painted by the most eminent scenic artists in America". Although based in New York City, it was intended as a national company that toured throughout the United States, with the goal of increasing American appreciation for opera by offering productions in English, by American performers, at affordable ticket prices. A succinct statement of Thurber's vision for the company appeared in the New York Times in August 1886, which reported that in her view "the true conception of a national opera is opera sung in a nation's language and, as far as practicable, the work of a nation's composers".
