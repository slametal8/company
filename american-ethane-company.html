<h1>American Ethane Company</h1>
            
            American Ethane Company, LLC (AEC) is the largest producer of ethane in the United States. It is a Houston, Texas, based American petroleum company established in January 2014 with offices in New Orleans. It is privately held with large investments from Russian oligarchs who are close to Vladimir Putin's inner circle.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Ownership and management ==<br/><br/>As of July 2018, Konstantin Nikolaev, Mikhail Yuriev, and Andrey Kunatbaev have a combined 88% stake in American Ethane and Alexander Voloshin has a secret 2.5% share worth $1.25 million in 2014 under an AV SPV in the remaining 12%.  Also in July 2018, Houghtaling confirmed that Alexander Abramov, who is Roman Abramovich's partner in Evraz, is an investor in American Ethane. Beginning in January 2014, Roman Abramovich was an investor with American Ethane but left in April 2017.<br/><br/>John Houghtaling II, a co-founder, is the CEO.<br/><br/>James Glickenhaus and J. M. “Jim” Collingsworth serve on the Board of Directors.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In January 2014, Roman Abramovich through his Millhouse LLC, which is a Moscow-based asset management company, signed an agreement at the John Houghtaling II house in New Orleans and made a $50 million investment in the American Ethane Company but backed out in late 2015 after the Russian intervention in Ukraine and the Russian annexation of Crimea because of sanctions against Russia. Nikolaev's investment was pivotal to keep American Ethane from becoming insolvent which would force a bankruptcy. In April 2017, Abramovich recouped $21 million to his Eucla Investments Ltd for the debt owed to Abramovich from Houghtaling of American Ethane.
