<h1>The American Success Company</h1>
            
            The American Success Company is a 1980 American comedy-drama film directed by William Richert and starring Jeff Bridges. It was written by Larry Cohen. Re-edited versions of the film have appeared under the titles American Success, Success, The Ringer, and Good as Gold.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Premise ==<br/><br/>Harry Flowers (Bridges) is routinely humiliated both at home and at work (the German offices of an American credit card company). Fed up, he hires prostitute Corinne (Bianca Jagger) to help him gain revenge on his quirky wife Sarah (Belinda Bauer) and her father/his boss, the overbearing Mr. Elliott (Ned Beatty) — all while enriching himself financially.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Cast ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Production ==<br/><br/>The film was based on an original script by Larry Cohen. At one stage he was going to make it starring Rock Hudson and Vanessa Redgrave, but this did not eventuate. Peter Sellers wanted to star, for $100,000, but Cohen could not raise finance on Sellers' name — this was just prior to the release of the smash 1975 film The Return of the Pink Panther. Michael Caine came close to starring, but eventually Cohen sold the script.
