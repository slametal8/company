            Adam &amp; Eve is an American  independent company that sells adult products through e-commerce. In 2004, it was the largest mail order distributor of sex toys, condoms, and erotica in the United States. Its parent company, PHE Inc., is the largest private employer in Hillsborough, North Carolina, where its headquarters are located. The company funds non-profit social marketing organizations that address issues such as population growth, disease control, and sex education in developing countries.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Origins ==<br/><br/>The firm was founded in 1970 by British physician Tim Black and American entrepreneur, philanthropist and libertarian Phil Harvey. It started as a small storefront in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, selling condoms and lubricants. It soon became a mail-order catalog selling contraceptives through non-medical channels.<br/><br/>While still graduate students in family planning and population dynamics at the University of North Carolina's School of Public Health, they conceived the firm to fund a non-profit organization to use the profits to finance family-planning programs in developing countries.<br/><br/>With a Ford Foundation fellowship, they devised a plan to use social marketing in the U.S., and with university consent, they began writing witty ad copy ("What will you get her this Christmas -- pregnant?") and advertising condoms in the mail and 300 of the largest U.S. college newspapers. Though selling condoms via the mail violated the Comstock Act (not overturned in its entirety until 1972), they knew the law was rarely enforced.
