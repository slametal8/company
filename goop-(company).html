            Goop is a wellness and lifestyle brand and company founded by the American actress Gwyneth Paltrow. It was launched in September 2008 as a weekly e-mail newsletter providing new age advice, such as "police your thoughts" and "eliminate white foods", and the slogan "Nourish the Inner Aspect". Goop expanded into e-commerce, collaborating with fashion brands, launching pop-up shops, holding a "wellness summit", launching a print magazine, a podcast, and a docuseries for Netflix.<br/><br/>Goop has faced criticism for marketing products and treatments that are harmful, described as "snake oil", based on pseudoscience, and lack efficacy. California officials from the Consumer Protection Office have sued Goop for false advertising, asserting that Goop has made unfounded health claims about a variety of products. Goop settled the lawsuit out of court. Class-action lawsuits have been brought against Goop for unsafe products.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Goop was founded in Paltrow's home in London, beginning as a newsletter in 2008, with an editor's note in each email from Paltrow offering insight into her daily life. Goop was incorporated in 2011. According to Paltrow, the company's name came from Peter Arnell telling her that successful internet companies have double Os in their name, and she "wanted it to be a word that means nothing and could mean anything".
