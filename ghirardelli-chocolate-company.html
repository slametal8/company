            The Ghirardelli Chocolate Company (simply known as Ghirardelli) is an American confectioner, wholly owned by Swiss confectioner Lindt &amp; Sprüngli. The company was founded by and is named after Italian chocolatier Domenico Ghirardelli, who, after working in South America, moved to California. The Ghirardelli Chocolate Company was incorporated in 1852, and is the third-oldest chocolate company in the US, after Baker's Chocolate and Whitman's.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Origins ===<br/><br/>In 1817, Domenico Ghirardelli was born in Rapallo, Italy, to an "exotic foods importer" and his wife. Domenico received his first education in the chocolate trade when he was apprenticed to a local candymaker as a child. By the time he was 20, Ghirardelli had sailed to Uruguay with his wife to work in a chocolate and coffee business. A year later, Ghirardelli moved to Lima, Peru, and opened a confectionery store. In 1847, nine years later, James Lick (Ghirardelli's neighbor) moved to San Francisco, California, with 600 lb (270 kg) of Ghirardelli's chocolate. Ghirardelli remained and continued to operate his store in Peru.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== The move to California ===<br/><br/>In 1849, Ghirardelli received news of the gold strike at Sutter's Mill and sailed to California.
