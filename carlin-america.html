<h1>Carlin America</h1>
            
            Carlin America is an American music publisher with a catalog of over 100,000 titles.  The company, created under its current name in 1995 by its founder Freddy Bienstock, is headquartered on East 38th Street in Manhattan. Bienstock died on September 29, 2009, after which Carlin Music was run by his children Robert and Caroline (after whom the publisher was named).<br/><br/>As of January 2018, Carlin operates as a division of American music publisher Round Hill Music.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In 1966 Freddy Bienstock acquired Belinda Music Publishing, which he renamed Carlin Music Corporation after his daughter, Caroline. He soon expanded the Carlin Music catalog by associations with such hit makers as Leiber &amp; Stoller in addition to representing Atlantic Records and Motown Records. Carlin was then named Publisher of the Year by Music Week for ten consecutive years.<br/><br/>In partnership with Leiber &amp; Stoller, Bienstock later formed Hudson Bay Music as the publisher's American business. Located in New York City on the top floor of the legendary Broadway landmark Brill Building, Hudson Bay rapidly acquired such major assets as the TM Music and Faithful Virtue Music catalogs, whose artists included Bobby Darin, Tim Hardin and John Sebastian, and the label and publishing divisions of Starday and King Records. His holdings were further enlarged by the acquisitions of the music publishing interests of The New York Times, the preeminent Broadway show catalog of its era, with scores such as Fiddler on the Roof, 'Cabaret', 'Company', 'Follies', 'Godspell', and hits by songwriters Peter Allen, Marvin Hamlisch, and Carole Bayer Sager.
