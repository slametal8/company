            Lineage, Inc. (formerly Lineage Logistics) is the world's largest temperature-controlled warehouse real estate investment trust (REIT), owned by Bay Grove, LLC. Entering international markets in 2017, Lineage grew into the world's largest refrigerated warehousing company with a capacity exceeding 3 billion cubic feet and acquiring more than 100 companies through the end of 2023. Lineage operates over 450 facilities across 18 countries, with approximately 26,000 team members globally in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The company was founded in April 2012 by former Morgan Stanley investment banker Adam Forste, who formed Bay Grove Capital, LLC, through the consolidation of acquired warehousing and logistics companies beginning, in December 2008, with the purchase of Seafreeze from Toyo Susian Kaisha. The company then acquired CityIce, in 2009, and Flint River Services, in 2010, followed, in 2011, by Terminal Freezers of Santa Maria, California, and Richmond Cold Storage, purchased from Atlanta Equity.<br/><br/>Lineage was formed with the fifth-largest network of temperature-controlled warehouse facilities in North America in 2012, according to International Association of Refrigerated Warehouses (IARW) rankings, with 40 facilities in eight states, including near international ports at Savannah, Georgia, Seattle, Washington and Norfolk, Virginia; as well as providing warehouse management, consulting, and food processing support.<br/><br/>In a March 2021 interview with Bloomberg, Lineage CEO Greg Lehmkuhl said the company is actively preparing its initial public offering (IPO). The company completed its IPO in July 2024 with a listing on the Nasdaq, raising around $4.5 billion, valuing the company at over $18 billion.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Operations and technology ==<br/><br/>By 2015, Lineage's facility network was ranked the second-largest in the world by the International Association of Refrigerated Warehouses. With 111 facilities in 21 states, Lineage also ranked as the second largest temperature-controlled warehousing and logistics company in the United States.
