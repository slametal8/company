            The Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, based in Youngstown, Ohio, was an American steel manufacturer. Officially, the company was created on November 23, 1900, when Articles of Incorporation of the Youngstown Iron Sheet and Tube Company were filed with the Ohio Secretary of State at Columbus. In 1905 the word "Iron" was dropped from the company name to reflect the company's shift in focus from producing wrought iron products to basic steel products. It acquired the Mark Manufacturing Company in 1923. Youngstown Sheet and Tube remained in business until 1977. A Youngstown resident  acquired the name, trademark, and logo in 2014 and opened a small business promoting the economic redevelopment of Youngstown.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In 1888, Youngstown industrialists George D. Wick and James A. Campbell organized the Mahoning Valley Iron Company, with Wick as president. Charles Dayton Arms, Wicks brother in law and also an iron entrepreneur, was brought in as president. Five years later, the two men resigned from the firm when it was taken over by the Republic Iron and Steel Company, and their next project would come in response to major changes that occurred in the community's industrial sector. Youngstown's industrial leaders began to convert from iron to steel manufacturing at the turn of the century, a period that also saw a wave of consolidations that placed much of the community's industry in the hands of national corporations.
