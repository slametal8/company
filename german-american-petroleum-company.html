            Deutsch-Amerikanische Petroleum Gesellschaft, also known as German-American Petroleum Company, was a German petroleum company that was a subsidiary of Standard Oil and was founded in 1890. From 1950 onwards the company was called Esso Deutschland GmbH and has been a subsidiary of the ExxonMobil group since 1999.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>On 25 February 1890 a joint venture between the German industrialists Franz Ernst Schütte, Carl Schütte and Wilhelm Anton Riedemann and the American industrialist John D. Rockefeller was agreed in the German city of Bremen to create a subsidiary of Standard Oil that would operate as a petroleum business in Germany.<br/><br/>In 1891, the petrol import business of Edmund Siemers was transferred to the company In the mid-1890s, the company took over half of the shares of the Bremen Petroleum Refinery.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the 20th century, the petroleum was sold under the brand DAPOL and the American gasoline under the brand DAPOLIN with the famous Indian head. In 1904, the Standard Oil Company took a 50 percent stake in the company and moved the company's headquarters to Hamburg.<br/><br/>After the Benzene association scientist, Walter Oswald had developed a super-gasoline in 1924 by adding benzene to gasoline., a DAPG delivery agreement enabled them to also offer a knock-resistant super gasoline by adding about 40% benzene. This product was called Duolin and sold in September 1928 as red-coloured Esso. A 10% benzene was added to the dapoline fuel to increase the knock resistance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1928 the tanker shipping company of the German-American Petroleum Society was renamed to the Waried Tankschiff Rhederei GmbH.<br/><br/>During the global economic crisis, the shares of MAN and Haniel in the Oelhag, the German petroleum company were bought by the German-American Petroleum Society and the German mineral oil company Rhenania-Ossag, that would be later called, Shell Germany Oil GmbH. ARCO, the American oil company sold so many shares at that time, that the three companies each owned a third of the shares.
