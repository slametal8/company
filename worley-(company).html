            Worley Limited is an Australian engineering and professional services company which provides consulting and project delivery expertise to the resources and energy sectors, and complex process industries.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early history ===<br/><br/>John Grill (chief executive officer 1975–2012), joined Smith, de Kantzow &amp; Wholohan, which led to the 1976 establishment Wholohan Grill and Partners, a small Australian engineering consultancy. Wholohan Grill and Partners grew steadily throughout the 1970s and 80s.<br/><br/>In 1987, Wholohan Grill and Partners acquired the Australian interests of Worley, an American-based engineering firm founded by Steve Worley. The company changed its name to Worley and from this point began expanding steadily, securing long-term contracts in Brunei, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, and creating local joint ventures, most of which are still active today.<br/><br/>In the 1990s, Worley expanded both its industry sector and geographical footprint.  A policy of diversification saw Worley grow from its roots in the hydrocarbons sector into the power, infrastructure and environment, and minerals and metals sectors. At the start of the new millennium, Worley was well poised to continue its industry sector and geographic expansion with 30 offices and 3,000 personnel globally.  This success enabled Worley to diversify further through additional partnerships and acquisitions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 2000s ===<br/><br/>In 2002 Worley became a publicly listed company on the Australian Stock Exchange, leading to a period of increased global acquisitions, including companies in Canada, Oman, and China.
