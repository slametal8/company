        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) stands as one of the most influential television networks in U.S. history. As the youngest of the "Big Three" American television networks (alongside CBS and NBC), ABC has carved out a unique position in broadcasting history through innovative programming, strategic mergers, and its eventual acquisition by The Walt Disney Company.</p>

        <h2>Early History: From Radio to Television</h2>
        <h3>The NBC Blue Network Origins</h3>
        <p>ABC's roots trace back to 1943 when it was established as the successor to the NBC Blue Network, which the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) forced NBC to sell due to antitrust concerns. Edward J. Noble, the owner of Life Savers candy, purchased the network for $8 million and renamed it the American Broadcasting Company.</p>

        <h3>Transition to Television</h3>
        <p>ABC began television operations on April 19, 1948, initially struggling to compete with the established networks CBS and NBC. The early years were financially difficult, with the network often ranking third in ratings. A turning point came in 1953 when ABC merged with United Paramount Theatres, bringing much-needed capital and the leadership of Leonard Goldenson.</p>

        <h2>The Golden Age of Television (1950s-1960s)</h2>
        <p>The 1950s saw ABC begin to establish itself through innovative programming strategies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Disneyland (1954):</strong> The groundbreaking deal with Walt Disney brought the first primetime television series produced by a movie studio.</li>
            <li><strong>Warner Bros. Partnership:</strong> ABC collaborated with Warner Bros. to produce popular westerns like "Maverick" and "Cheyenne."</li>
            <li><strong>Youth Programming:</strong> Recognizing an underserved market, ABC targeted younger viewers with shows like "American Bandstand."</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Network That Invented the TV Movie</h2>
        <p>In 1964, ABC revolutionized television with the first made-for-TV movie, "The Killers," starring Ronald Reagan in his final acting role. This innovation led to the ABC Movie of the Week, a franchise that became a television staple for decades.</p>

        <h2>The 1970s: Rise to Competitive Parity</h2>
        <p>Under the leadership of Fred Silverman, ABC transformed from perennial underdog to ratings leader through:</p>
