            The Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) was a holding company of manufacturers of record-keeping and measuring systems; it was subsequently known as IBM.<br/><br/>In 1911, the financier and noted trust organizer Charles R. Flint, called the "Father of Trusts", amalgamated (via stock acquisition) four companies: Bundy Manufacturing Company, International Time Recording Company, the Tabulating Machine Company, and the Computing Scale Company of America; creating a fifth company – the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company.<br/><br/>CTR was initially located in Endicott, New York. The amalgamated companies had 1,300 employees and manufactured a wide range of products, including employee time-keeping systems, weighing scales, automatic meat slicers, and punched card equipment.<br/><br/>CTR was renamed the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) in 1924.<br/><br/>The individual companies continued to operate using their established names until the businesses were integrated in 1933, and the holding company was eliminated.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Companies amalgamated ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Bundy Manufacturing Company ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>The first time clock was invented on November 20, 1888, by Willard Bundy, a jeweler in Auburn, New York. A year later, his brother, Harlow Bundy, organized the Bundy Manufacturing Company, and began mass-producing time clocks.<br/><br/>In 1900, Bundy Manufacturing sold its time recording business to a new company, the International Time Recording Company. Bundy Manufacturing went on to produce adding machines.<br/><br/>In 1906 Harlow Bundy moved his business into a new three-story brick building in Endicott, New York.
