It was a member of the Tin Can Trust, that controlled a "large percentage of business in the United States in tin cans, containers, and packages of tin." American Can Company ranked 97th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts. During its peak of productivity, the American Can Company employed up to 800 people. It was a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 1959 to 1991. After 1987 it was known as Primerica, a financial conglomerate which divested itself of its packaging arm in 1986.<br/><br/>Primerica, after it was merged with Sanford I. Weill's Commercial Credit Company, would form the basis of what would become Citigroup.The American Can Company had its headquarters at the Pershing Square Building in Manhattan, New York City, until 1970, when it moved into a Greenwich, Connecticut, facility, which had been developed on 150 acres (61 ha) of wooded land in the late 1960s. In the early 1980s American Can renamed itself and ended its operations in Greenwich.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The American Can Company was incorporated in 1901.<br/><br/>In 1904, the American Can Company of Greenwich, Connecticut bought the small Norton Can Company that had operated since 1887 at York and Bay Streets (Toronto,  Ontario).
