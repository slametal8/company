            American Cruise Lines is the largest river and small-ship cruise line in the United States with its headquarters in Guilford, Connecticut. The line operates nineteen small U.S.-flagged cruise ships along the Eastern Seaboard (Maine to Florida, Hudson River, and Chesapeake Bay) and Western Seaboard (including Alaska and Puget Sound) as well as the Mississippi, Ohio, Cumberland, and Tennessee Rivers and the Columbia-Snake river system in the United States.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>American Cruise Lines was incorporated in 1991.  The company operates the largest and only 100% U.S.-flagged fleet of riverboats and small cruise ships in the world, with 19 new riverboats and small cruise ships exploring around the United States, including five riverboats on the Mississippi River and five on the Columbia and Snake rivers. In 2023, American Cruise Lines launched two 100-passenger Coastal Cats, American Eagle and American Glory; the first and second ships in the company's newest series of twelve small ships for the U.S. market (both are namesakes of original company vessels that have since been retired). The company operates both classic paddlewheelers and a fleet of new modern riverboats, including the first modern riverboat in the country, American Song, which debuted in 2018, and was named one of Time magazine's "World's Greatest Places" in 2019. American's four classic paddlewheel riverboats were redesigned and renamed in 2022. Paddlewheelers Queen of the Mississippi, Queen of the West, and America became American Heritage, American West, and American Splendor (American Pride retained its original name). In 2017 and 2018, American Cruise Lines launched two new small coastal cruise ships, the 170-passenger American Constellation and American Constitution. All American Cruise Lines' riverboats and small ships cruise only in the United States following 100% U.S. itineraries along U.S. rivers as well as the protected coastal waters along the East and West coasts (all the company's itineraries visit only U.S. ports of call).
