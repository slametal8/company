<h1>American Sheet &amp; Tin Plate Co.</h1>
            
            American Sheet and Tin Plate Company was an American industrial company specialized in tinplate products, incorporated in New Jersey with offices at the Frick Building in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and operations around the United States. The company produced sheets of steel, coated with a thin layer of tin.<br/><br/>Photographs of the company's plant are part of the archive collections of Indiana University.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early years ===<br/><br/>The company, amalgamated with the United States Steel Corporation, was formed in November 1903 with the merger of the American Tin Plate Company and the American Sheet Steel company. At the time of the merger a total of seventy-one plants were included in the consolidation of the companies.<br/><br/>During April 1906 the company started the Sabraton Works plant at Morgantown, West Virginia, at a time when the scarcity of steel was affecting the operation of tin plate plants.<br/><br/>The company experienced labor unrest in 1919.<br/><br/>The company was involved in a U.S. Supreme Court case (1937).<br/><br/>The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint against the company and fourteen other corporations involved in the manufacturing and sale of tin plate on February 17, 1936, accusing them of collusion, dating to an agreement made October 1934 to suppress the sale and distribution of certain grades and qualities of tin plate. Shortly following this action, the company was merged with the Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corporation, the largest subsidiary of U.S. Steel, effected May 29, 1936.
