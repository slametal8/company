            Marmot is an outdoor recreation clothing and sporting goods company founded in 1974 as "Marmot Mountain Works". The company was founded in Grand Junction, Colorado by local resident Tom Boyce and two University of California, Santa Cruz students, David Huntley and Eric Reynolds, who shared the common goal of making their own mountaineering equipment.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1976, Marmot ventured on another new business opportunity when Eric Reynolds met Joe Tanner of W. L. Gore &amp; Associates. Within a couple of weeks, Marmot had sewn prototype sleeping bags using the then-new Gore-Tex fabric for field testing. Reynolds and Huntley spent seven nights in a commercial frozen meat locker comparing bags with and without the Gore-Tex fabric, as well as testing the bags under fire sprinklers. They were impressed by what they saw and changed everything in the Marmot line to Gore-Tex fabrications.<br/><br/>By the early twenty-first century, Marmot was owned by K2 Sports, and in August 2007, holding company and conglomerate Jarden acquired K2 Sports for approximately US$1.2 billion.  K2 included brands such as Marker, Marmot, Rawlings, Sevylor, Shakespeare, and Völkl under its umbrella.<br/><br/>After Jarden was acquired by Newell Rubbermaid in 2016, K2 Sports was sold to Kohlberg &amp; Company in 2017. Marmot was spun off from K2 and stayed with Newell.
