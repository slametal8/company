            The Trust Company of America was a large company in New York City. Founded on May 23, 1899 in Albany, New York, its founding president was Ashbel P. Fitch and it was initially located in the Singer Building in Manhattan's Financial District. In 1907 the company absorbed the Colonial Trust Company, a commercial bank. During the Panic of 1907 it was the target of a bank run starting on October 23, 1907, which it survived with the backing of J. Pierpont Morgan and an infusion of gold from the Bank of England and other European sources. The company ultimately represented a consolidation of the North American Trust Company, the former Trust Company of America, the City Trust Company and the Colonial Trust Company. The Trust Company of America was absorbed by the Equitable Trust Company in the spring of 1912.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 1899-1903: Formation ===<br/><br/>The Trust Company of America commenced business in 1895.
