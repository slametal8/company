            The Buhl Aircraft Company was a US aircraft manufacturer founded in Detroit in 1925 which remained in operation until 1933. Buhl designed and manufactured the Buhl-Verville CA-3 Airster, the first aircraft to receive a US civil aviation type Certificate in March 1927. Several utility and sport aircraft models were developed from 1925 to 1931, both fixed wings and rotary wing aircraft. Their greatest successes were with the Airsedan and Bull Pup, with approximately 185 aircraft of all types built from 1925 to 1932.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The Buhl Aircraft Company was founded in 1925 by the Buhl family of Detroit. Lawrence D. Buhl hired Etienne Dormoy and Alfred Verville who had previously been employed as engineers by the United States Army Air Service Engineering Division at McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio. Then, in 1926, the company purchased the former Illinois Tool Company factory and converted it for aircraft production.<br/><br/>The first aircraft to receive an Approved Type Certificate in the United States was the Buhl CA-3 Airster biplane which received Certificate #1 in March 1927. This was a commercial three seat open cockpit biplane suitable for carrying a couple of passengers, training student pilots and carrying light cargo. Other jobs such as crop dusting and aerial photography would be added later.
