            The Insurance Company of North America Building, now known as The Phoenix, is a historic commercial building in downtown Philadelphia.  Built in 1925, it was for many years the home of the  Insurance Company of North America (INA), the nation's first and oldest joint-stock insurance company.  It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978.  The building, occupied by INA until 1991, has been developed into condominiums.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Description and history ==<br/><br/>The former Insurance Company of North America Building is located on the west side of JFK Plaza, just north of Suburban Station in Philadelphia's central Penn Center area.  It is a sixteen-story steel-framed commercial building, finished in brick and stone, occupying an entire city block bounded by Arch, Cuthbert, 16th and 17th Streets.  It has a 65-foot (20 m) granite lower level, above which rises a tower of ten uniform stories in brick, topped by a four-story crown.  The building was designed by architects Stewardson &amp; Page, formerly Cope &amp; Stewardson, and built by Stone &amp; Webster, Inc.<br/><br/>The building was built to house the headquarters of the Insurance Company of North America (INA), then one of the largest property insurance companies in the United States.  The company was founded in 1794, and was the nation's first joint-stock company devoted to selling insurance.
