        <p class="image-caption">Alterra Mountain Company's distinctive logo representing its collection of premier mountain destinations</p>

        <p>Alterra Mountain Company has emerged as one of the most influential forces in the North American ski industry since its establishment in 2018. Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, this innovative hospitality company owns and operates some of the continent's most iconic ski resorts while pioneering new approaches to mountain experiences through its groundbreaking Ikon Pass.</p>

        <div class="resort-feature">
            <h3>Key Facts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Founded:</strong> January 2018</li>
                <li><strong>Headquarters:</strong> Denver, Colorado</li>
                <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> KSL Capital Partners and Henry Crown and Company</li>
                <li><strong>Resorts Owned:</strong> 15 destination mountain resorts</li>
                <li><strong>Ikon Pass Partners:</strong> 47 total destinations worldwide</li>
                <li><strong>Annual Visitors:</strong> Over 10 million skier visits</li>
                <li><strong>CEO:</strong> Jared Smith (as of 2021)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Corporate History and Formation</h2>
        <p>The creation of Alterra Mountain Company represents one of the most significant consolidations in ski industry history. The company was formed through a series of strategic acquisitions that brought together some of North America's most prestigious ski resorts under single ownership.</p>

        <h3>The Acquisition Spree (2017-2018)</h3>
        <p>Alterra's formation began in April 2017 when private equity firm KSL Capital Partners, in partnership with the Crown family (owners of Aspen Skiing Company), purchased Intrawest Resort Holdings for approximately $1.5 billion. This acquisition included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Steamboat Ski Resort (Colorado)</li>
            <li>Winter Park Resort (Colorado)</li>
            <li>Mont Tremblant (Quebec)</li>
            <li>Blue Mountain (Ontario)</li>
            <li>Stratton Mountain Resort (Vermont)</li>
            <li>Snowshoe Mountain (West Virginia)</li>
            <li>Canadian Mountain Holidays heli-skiing operations</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Just days later, the same investment group acquired Mammoth Resorts, adding:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mammoth Mountain (California)</li>
            <li>June Mountain (California)</li>
            <li>Bear Mountain (California)</li>
            <li>Snow Summit (California)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The buying spree continued in August 2017 with the purchase of Utah's Deer Valley Resort, known for its luxury amenities and meticulously groomed slopes. These acquisitions were combined with KSL's existing holdings of Squaw Valley and Alpine Meadows (now collectively known as Palisades Tahoe) to form Alterra Mountain Company in January 2018.</p>

        <div class="quote">
            <p>"The formation of Alterra Mountain Company represents a transformative moment for the ski industry. By bringing together these iconic resorts, we're creating new opportunities for guests to experience the mountains while investing in the future of each destination."</p>
