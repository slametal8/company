The firm opened in New York and Los Angeles, and became a top 10 ranked M&amp;A advisor in the US in its first full year of operations, advising on transactions such as Anheuser-Busch's $61.2 billion sale to InBev, Yahoo's defense from Microsoft's $44.6 billion unsolicited proposal, and Hilton Hotels' $26.5 billion sale to The Blackstone Group.<br/><br/>In July 2008, Moelis opened its restructuring practice by hiring the co-heads of Jefferies' restructuring and advising on the $22.2 billion reorganization of Delphi Automotive, and the $29.6 billion reorganization of AMR Corp and $17.0 billion merger with US Airways Group. Matthew Prest, the restructuring head of European corporate finance firm Close Brothers, soon followed with his team to join Moelis in London.
