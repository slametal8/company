            AT&amp;T Corporation, an abbreviation for its former name, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, was an American telecommunications company that provided voice, video, data, and Internet telecommunications and professional services to businesses, consumers, and government agencies.<br/><br/>During the Bell System's long history, AT&amp;T was at times the world's largest telecommunications company, the world's largest cable television operator, and a regulated monopoly. At its peak in the 1950s and 1960s, it employed one million people and its revenue ranged between US$3 billion in 1950 ($42.6 billion in present-day terms) and $12 billion in 1966 ($120 billion in present-day terms).<br/><br/>In 2005, AT&amp;T was acquired by "Baby Bell" and former subsidiary SBC Communications for more than $16 billion ($25.8 billion in present-day terms). SBC then changed its name to AT&amp;T Inc., with AT&amp;T Corporation continuing to exist as a long-distance calling subsidiary until its dissolution on May 1, 2024.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Origins ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>AT&amp;T started with Bell Patent Association, a legal entity established in 1874 to protect the patent rights of Alexander Graham Bell after he invented the telephone system. Originally a verbal agreement, it was formalized in writing in 1875 as Bell Telephone Company.<br/><br/>In 1880 the management of American Bell created what would become AT&amp;T Long Lines. The project was the first of its kind to create a nationwide long-distance network with a commercially viable cost-structure. The project was formally incorporated in New York as a separate company named American Telephone and Telegraph Company on March 3, 1885.
