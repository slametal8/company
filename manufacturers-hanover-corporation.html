            Manufacturers Hanover Corporation  was an American bank holding company that was formed as parent of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company (MHT or, informally, Manny Hanny), a large New York City bank formed through a merger in 1961 with ancestor companies, especially the Manufacturers Trust Company, having had a long history in New York banking going back to the 1850s.  After 1969, Manufacturers Hanover Trust became a subsidiary of Manufacturers Hanover Corporation.  Throughout most of its existence, Manufacturers Hanover Trust was the fourth-largest bank in the United States.<br/><br/>MHT was both a major money center bank and heavily engaged in retail banking.<br/><br/>As such, the bank was known for stability and was well established via its personal accounts base tied to New York branch locations as well as in having a number of large blue-chip corporate customers.  It ran several memorable advertising campaigns in the 1970s and also had some prominent sports sponsorship arrangements. Over time it gained substantial operations in other parts of the United States as well as overseas.<br/><br/>But by the late 1980s, Manufacturers Hanover had fallen in rank among American banks and was troubled by a number of bad loans, especially ones in Latin America.  In 1991 it merged into Chemical Banking Corporation and within a couple of years had disappeared under its name. However it continued to have an influence via some of its executives, internal systems, and its presence at 270 Park Avenue which successor corporations down to  JPMorgan Chase continued to locate their headquarters in.
