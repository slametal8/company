            The Stanley Motor Carriage Company was an American manufacturer of steam cars that operated from 1902 to 1924, going defunct after it failed to adapt to competition from rapidly improving Internal combustion engine vehicles. The cars made by the company were colloquially called Stanley Steamers although several different models were produced.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early history ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Twins Francis E. Stanley (1849–1918) and Freelan O. Stanley (1849–1940) founded the company, after selling their photographic dry plate business to Eastman Kodak. They made their first car in 1897. During 1898 and 1899, they produced and sold over 200 cars, more than any other U.S. maker. <br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1899, Freelan and his wife Flora drove one of their cars to the top of Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the highest peak in the northeastern United States. The ascent took more than two hours and was notable as being the first time a car had climbed the 7.6 miles (12.2 km) long Mount Washington Carriage Road. The Stanleys later sold the rights to this early design to Locomobile. In 1902 they formed their own Stanley Motor Carriage Company.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Specifications and design ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Early Stanley cars had light wooden bodies mounted on wooden "perch poles" with full-elliptic springs.
