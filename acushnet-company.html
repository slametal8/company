            The Acushnet Company is an American company focused on the golf market. The company operates a series of brands that manufacture golf equipment, clothing and accessories.<br/><br/>The principal brands operated by Acushnet are Titleist, best known for balls and clubs; FootJoy, an apparel brand with particular focus on shoes and gloves; Scotty Cameron, a leading putter brand; Vokey Design, a leading brand of wedge; Union Green, a golf ball and accessory brand marketed to casual players; and Pinnacle, a brand of distance ball.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Founded in Acushnet, Massachusetts by Philip E. "Skipper" Young in 1910, the "Acushnet Process Company" focused on deresinating latex and supplying rubber to industry, and over time began to make their own rubber-based products including water bottles and bathing caps.  Eventually, Acushnet Process became a manufacturer of golf equipment, principally, golf balls.<br/><br/>In 1932, the company sectioned into two divisions: Rubber and Golf, both of which became quite successful. Three years later, the Golf division produced the Titleist golf ball, which has consistently been the company's most successful product.<br/><br/>In 1976, the company was purchased by American Brands (now known as Fortune Brands). In 1995, Fortune sold off the Acushnet Company's Acushnet Rubber division, which was Acushnet's original business (circa early 1900s).<br/><br/>Fortune Brands announced on December 8, 2010, that it planned to focus on its liquor business, and would spin off or sell other parts of the company — including home furnishings and hardware, and Acushnet (which includes Titleist, FootJoy, Scotty Cameron, and other golf product brands).
