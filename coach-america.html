            Coach America, also doing business as American Coach Lines, was a holding company for American bus services owned by New York-based private equity firm Fenway Partners operating under the Coach America, American Coach Lines, and Gray Line names (at some locations, operating under pre-existing branding). Coach America consisted of all former Coach USA operations except for the midwestern United States, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New England, along with Lakefront Lines in Ohio (acquired separately). For the nine years of its existence, Coach America was based in Dallas, Texas.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The properties that became Coach America were previously owned by Scotland-based Stagecoach Group as Coach USA's Western, South Central, and Southeastern divisions. Coach America was formed in 2003 when, after Stagecoach Group evaluated its Coach USA business, it decided to retain mostly its scheduled and local transit services in the Northeast and North Central region and put the rest of the company up for sale. The South Central and West divisions of Coach USA were sold to Kohlberg &amp; Co., LLC, with these companies continuing to use the Coach USA name for a time, but eventually changing to Coach America. The Southeast division was sold to a separate buyer, Lincolnshire Management, and became American Coach Lines.<br/><br/>In 2006, Coach America purchased American Coach Lines from Lincolnshire. In November of that same year, Kohlberg sold Coach America to another private equity firm, Fenway Partners. Coach America acquired the Ohio carrier Lakefront Lines in 2008.
