            The Fred Harvey Company was the owner of the Harvey House chain of restaurants, hotels and other hospitality industry businesses alongside railroads in the Western United States. It was founded in 1876 by Fred Harvey to cater to the growing number of train passengers.<br/><br/>When Harvey died in 1901, his family inherited 45 restaurants and 20 dining cars in 12 states. During World War II, Harvey Houses opened again to serve soldiers as they traveled in troop trains across the U.S. By 1968, when it was sold to Amfac, Inc. (now Xanterra Parks and Resorts, as of 2002), the Fred Harvey Company was the sixth largest food retailer in the United States. It left behind a lasting legacy of good food, dedication to customers, decent treatment of employees, and preservation of local traditions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The company traces its origins to the 1876 opening of three railroad eatery-hotels located at Wallace, Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, and Hugo, Colorado, on the Kansas Pacific Railway. These cafés were opened by Fred Harvey, then a freight agent for the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad, who emigrated to the United States from London, England, when he was 17 years old. These initial few café operations ended within a year, but their success had convinced Harvey of the potential profitability in providing higher-quality food and service experiences at railroad eating establishments. The Burlington Railroad (Harvey's longtime employer) declined his offer of establishing a system-wide operation with an eatery at every en-route meal stop, but the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway (AT&amp;SF) subsequently contracted with Harvey for what would become several "Harvey Houses" on an experimental basis.
