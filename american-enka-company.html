            The American Enka Company was an American company that was the nation's largest rayon fiber manufacturer. Founded in 1928, its research division developed such things as Tyrex (for the tire cord market), improved rayon and nylon, and by-products for detergent makers and paper mills. It helped bolster the economies of Western North Carolina, West Virginia, Eastern Kentucky, Eastern Tennessee, Northern Georgia  and Northern Alabama during the Great Depression and thereafter; its founding in 1928 by Dutch capital led the way for German, Swiss, and British investments in the American South, and it was one of the companies on the original Fortune 500 list.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Founding ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The American Enka Company was established outside of Asheville, North Carolina, in late September 1928 by a Dutch firm, the Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek (Netherlands Artificial Silk Company).  The name is derived from the sound of N-K, the initial letters of the parent firm, spoken in Dutch.<br/><br/>The Netherlands' Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek was founded by Jacques Coenraad Hartogs shortly before World War I.  By 1928, it had merged with several other Dutch and German firms, so that Business Week would subsequently describe it as a "giant international textile combine".  Already in 1924, it looked toward expanding into the American marketplace.  Simultaneously, it and other like manufacturers worldwide were experiencing difficulties with the manufacturing devices to make synthetic fibers because they easily and continually broke down.<br/><br/>The Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek (ENKA) was a member of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce's heavy industry division whose president at the time was Rento Hofstede Crull, the Dutch electrical pioneer who already had founded several companies.  Hartogs and Hofstede Crull had become friends over the years; and Hartogs turned to him about the problem with the spinning devices.
