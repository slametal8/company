            Chewy, Inc. is an American online retailer of pet food and other pet-related products based in Plantation, Florida. Chewy went public in 2019 with the ticker symbol CHWY on the New York Stock Exchange.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 2011–2019: Founding, acquisition and pre-IPO ===<br/><br/>Chewy was founded with the name "Mr. Chewy" in June 2011 by Ryan Cohen and Michael Day. In March 2012, the company estimated a total yearly revenue of $26 million, despite losing money in its first half year. By 2017, the company had revenue of approximately $2 billion and 51% of online pet food sales in the US. At that time, CEO Ryan Cohen prepared to take Chewy public as both Petco and PetSmart approached with merger offers.  Petco's offer would be paid for in part using stock, whereas PetSmart offered an all-cash bid that would also allow Chewy to remain a completely separate business. In 2017, Chewy was purchased by PetSmart, a retail entity backed by private equity firm BC Partners, for $3.35 billion, which at the time was the largest ever acquisition of an e-commerce business.<br/><br/>Following the acquisition, Cohen remained CEO and operated the business largely as an independent unit of PetSmart.
