            Dyson Limited, d.b.a Dyson, is a Singaporean–British  multinational technology company. Founded in 1991 by James Dyson in Malmesbury, England, the company designs and manufactures household appliances such as vacuum cleaners, air purifiers, hand dryers, bladeless fans, heaters, hair dryers, and lights. As of 2022, Dyson has more than 14,000 employees worldwide. In 2019, Dyson moved the headquarters from the United Kingdom to Singapore to be closer to its manufacturing and supply-chain hubs and Asian customer base.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early years ===<br/><br/>In the 1970s, James Dyson bought a Hoover Junior vacuum cleaner, which lost suction after a period of use. Frustrated, Dyson emptied the disposable paper bag to try to restore the suction but this had no effect. On opening the bag to investigate, he noticed a layer of dust inside, clogging the fine material mesh.<br/><br/>Later, Dyson was working on his ballbarrow at a company he had founded (but no longer entirely owned) where a large vacuum system was used to contain the fusion bonded epoxy coating that was sprayed on the wheelbarrow arms as a powder coating.  Dyson found the system inefficient, and was told by equipment manufacturers that giant cyclone systems were better.  Centrifugal separators are a typical method of collecting dirt, dust and debris in industrial settings, but such methods usually were not applied on a smaller scale because of the higher cost.
