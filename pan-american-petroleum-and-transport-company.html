            The Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company (PAT) was an oil company founded in 1916 by the American oil tycoon Edward L. Doheny after he had made a huge oil strike in Mexico. Pan American profited from fuel demand during World War I, and from the subsequent growth in use of automobiles. For several years Pan American was the largest American oil company, with production assets in the United States, Mexico and Venezuela and marketing operations in the United States, Mexico, the United Kingdom and Brazil. In 1924 Pan American was involved in the Teapot Dome scandal over irregularities in the award of a U.S. government oil concession. Standard Oil of Indiana obtained a majority stake in 1925. The company sold its foreign properties to Standard Oil of New Jersey in 1932. What was left of Pan American, was merged with Standard Oil of Indiana in 1954, later renamed to Amoco after the American Oil Company, a Pan American subsidiary.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Origins ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Edward L. Doheny was a prospector who became wealthy  in the 1880s from silver mines in the Black Range of New Mexico.<br/><br/>In 1892 he moved with his family to Los Angeles, where he sank a mine and found oil at the corner of Patton Street and West State Street. This began an oil boom in Los Angeles.
